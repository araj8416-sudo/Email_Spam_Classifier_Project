# Email_Spam_Classifier_Project
 

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Spam Email Classifier** that detects and filters spam emails based on their content.  
The model is trained using a custom dataset and implements machine learning algorithms 
like **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to achieve accurate classification.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Created a custom dataset of spam and ham (non-spam) emails.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned text data (stopwords removal, stemming, lemmatization).  
   - Converted text into numerical representation using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Trained models using:  
     - Naive Bayes  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Compared performance of different classifiers.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Visualized confusion matrix for better insights.  

5. **Deployment Ready**  
   - The notebook is structured step-by-step for beginners.  
   - Can be extended to a web app using Flask/Django + Streamlit for UI.  

## üìä Results  
- Achieved **high accuracy** in detecting spam emails.  
- SVM performed slightly better than Naive Bayes for text classification.
